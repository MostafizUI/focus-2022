          There are many ways I can stay focused stayin focused is really hard
          for me to do. There are many times my mind wonder off which cost me to
          lose focus on whatever I am doing. Staying Focused effects alot of
          people in the world especially people thats in school that have kids
          In this report I will be talking about many ways that I can stay
          focused. I have a problem with staying focused I am a single mom with
          two kids and it is really hard trying to be focused with them around.
